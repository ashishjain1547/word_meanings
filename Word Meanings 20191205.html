Alpha male:
‘Maybe the . . . human alpha male is a combination of disgruntled male wish fulfilment and borderlinepseudoscientific justification for resorting to bullying, intimidation and generally all-round unpleasant behaviour by men hoping to impose their will on a world they find too complex and unnerving so revert to their baser instincts to get what they want, despite knowing deep down they don’t deserve it and shouldn’t have it’ — Dean Burnett, neuroscientist

Usage:
But Modi’s friendly hug at the July 2017 G20 Summit in Hamburg elicited something else altogether with Macron reciprocating warmly (in contrast to his predecessor Francois Hollande’s manifest discomfort with Modi’s embrace). This spectacle of international meetings as physical contests between leaders—obvious alpha male behaviour—is not entirely alien to the political sensibility in the subcontinent. Recall that just after India’s nuclear tests in May 1998, the then BJP chief minister of Delhi Madan Lal Khurana, in a fit of braggadocio, had challenged Pakistan to step into the akhada (wrestling pit)!

GDP:
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.

Gross domestic product per capita at nominal values. This is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market exchange rates to current U.S. dollars, divided by the average population for the same year.

Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory that measures prices at different locations using a common good or goods to contrast the real purchasing power between different currencies. In that case, PPP produces an exchange rate that equals the price of the basket of goods at one location over the price of the basket of goods at a different location. The PPP exchange rate may be different from the market exchange rate because of transportation costs, tariffs, and other frictions. PPP exchange rates are widely used when comparing GDP from different countries.

What Is the Trans-Pacific Partnership?
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement among 11 Pacific Rim economies. The United States was included initially. In 2015, Congress gave Barack Obama fast-track authority to negotiate the deal and put it to an up-or-down vote without amendments; all 12 nations signed the agreement in February 2016. The following August, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there would not be a vote on the deal before Obama left office. 


Since both major-party nominees, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton, opposed the deal, it was considered to be dead on arrival. Trump's victory solidified that view, and on January 23, 2017 he signed a memo instructing the U.S. trade representative to withdraw the U.S. as a signatory to the deal and pursue bilateral negotiations instead.

Third World

The "three worlds" of the Cold War era, April – August 1975
1st World: Western Bloc led by the USA and its allies
2nd World: Eastern Bloc led by the USSR, China, and their allies
3rd World: Non-Aligned and neutral countries
During the Cold War, the term Third World referred to the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the nations not aligned with either the First World or the Second World. This usage has become popular , mostly in the western countries, due to the ending of the Cold War.

In the decade following the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the term Third World was used interchangeably with developing countries, but the concept has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world. The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Eastern Bloc (the Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, "Third World" was a political, rather than an economic, grouping.

French demographer, anthropologist and historian Alfred Sauvy, in an article published in the French magazine L'Observateur, August 14, 1952, coined the term Third World (French: Tiers Monde), referring to countries that were unaligned with either the Communist Soviet bloc or the Capitalist NATO bloc during the Cold War.
