Ad hominem (Latin for "to the person"), short for argumentum ad hominem, typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The terms ad mulierem and ad feminam have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.

Example: such as the attacks on the character of Greta Thunberg by Donald Trump (US president) and Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron (France president).

Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish environmental activist on climate change whose campaigning has gained international recognition. Thunberg is known for her straightforward speaking manner, both in public and to political leaders and assemblies, in which she urges immediate action to address what she describes as the climate crisis.

The President of France, officially the President of the French Republic (French: président de la République française, French pronunciation: ​[pʁezidɑ̃ də la ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛːz]), is the executive head of state of France in the French Fifth Republic. In French terms, the presidency is the supreme magistracy of the country. 

The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, as well as their relation with the Prime Minister and Government of France, have over time differed with the various constitutional documents since the French Second Republic. The President of the French Republic is also the ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra, Grand Master of the Legion of Honour and of the National Order of Merit. The officeholder is also honorary proto-canon of the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome (although some have rejected the title in the past). 
The current President of the French Republic is Emmanuel Macron, who succeeded François Hollande on 14 May 2017.

Representatives and Senators are both congresspeople.

The US congress consists of two effectively co-equal chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are a few functional differences: Senators serve for six year terms, representatives have to run for election every two years. There are two senators from each state, but representatives are based on population (California has 53 representatives, Wyoming has one). But both chambers have to pass a bill in order for it to become a law, which is the primary function of congress.

Traditionally, the Senate is thought of as the loftier, more deliberative, more elite body. Once upon a time, Senators were appointed by the state legislature, to keep some separation from the popular vote. Nowadays, though, Senators are directly elected. The main difference is that representatives have specific districts that elect them, while Senators are elected by the state as a whole.
Because being a Senator is somewhat more prestigious, Senators are usually referred to as such, though they're technically congresspeople. Representatives are usually referred to as "congressman" or "congresswoman". But the only distinction is which part of congress they're in.

"the belief in correspondences between the Universe and Man—between microcosm and macrocosm"

...

Macrocosm and microcosm refers to a vision of cosmos where the part (microcosm) reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature "present in all esoteric schools of thinking", according to scholar Pierre A. Riffard.[2] It is closely associated with Hermeticism and underlies practices such as astrology, alchemy and sacred geometry with its premise of "As Above, So Below".[3]

Today, the concept of microcosm has been dominated by sociology to mean a small group of individuals whose behavior is typical of a larger social body encompassing it. A microcosm can be seen as a special kind of epitome. Conversely, a macrocosm is a social body made of smaller compounds. In physics, scale invariance describes the same phenomenon, although the universe as a whole is not physically scale invariant according to the modern understanding. However, scale invariance does appear in some physical systems, such as electrical breakdown.

This theory was initiated by Pythagoras who saw the cosmos and the body as a harmonious unity. He expressed this connection with his concept of microcosm and macrocosm.

Eventually, Salomon (NYSE:SB) was acquired by Travelers Group in 1998; and, following the latter's merger with Citicorp that same year, Salomon became part of Citigroup.

Origin

Old English rōther ‘paddle, oar’, of West Germanic origin; related to Dutch roer, German Ruder, also to the verb row2.


.....

A rudder is a primary control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, aircraft, or other conveyance that moves through a fluid medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull (watercraft) or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag.
