Neutraceutical:

The term nutraceutical, originally coined by Stephen De Felice [42], is, in this context, intended as: (i) the phytocomplex for food or part of food of vegetal origin; and (ii) the pool of secondary metabolites for food or part of food of animal origin [43]. This novel concept’ definition has been proposed to better evaluate the standard term of the word nutraceutical, and to highlight the difference between nutraceuticals, food supplements, and the many other plant-food-derived compounds that claim health-promoting effects. Nutraceuticals must be administered in a proper pharmaceutical way to guarantee high bioavailability and efficacy, and used in areas that go “beyond the diet and before the drugs” [44]. Nutraceuticals form a growing and powerful toolbox that is triggering a revolution in the area of disease prevention and also in the treatment for some clinical situations, in particular for individuals who may not yet be eligible for conventional pharmaceutical therapy, e.g., with conditions linked to metabolic syndrome. It is therefore necessary to unequivocally determine the definition of nutraceuticals, and to have an internationally shared regulation framework. It would also be advisable to determine nutraceuticals’ safety, modes of action and efficacy with clinical data before naming a product as “nutraceutical”, a term that must be substantiated by safety, no side effects, and proven health beneficial properties.
